Recipes
-------

Each directory contains recipes using the ``steam`` package.
See the individual ``README`` for details.

All recipes assume the enviroment is already set up.
In order not to break any system packages we will use ``virtualenv``.

.. code:: bash

    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env)$ pip install steam

To deactivate

.. code:: bash

    (env)$ deactivate
